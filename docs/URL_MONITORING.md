# URL Monitoring Implementation

## Problem
Chrome content scripts inject into pages and persist during SPA (Single Page Application) navigation. When users navigate from `/alert-debug` to other pages like `/home`, the extension's UI elements (notepad, modals, etc.) would remain visible.

## Solution: Force Page Reload

Instead of trying to manually clean up all DOM elements and state, we force a page reload when users navigate away from `/alert-debug`. This ensures:

✅ **Complete cleanup** - No leftover DOM elements or event listeners
✅ **Fresh state** - No memory leaks or stale references  
✅ **Bulletproof** - Works regardless of how complex the extension becomes
✅ **Simple** - No complex cleanup logic needed

## How It Works

### 1. URL Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor all navigation methods
- history.pushState/replaceState (SPA routing)
- popstate events (back/forward buttons)
- hashchange events (hash routing)
- Periodic fallback check (2 second intervals)
```

### 2. Detection Logic
```javascript
if (wasOnAlertDebug && !isOnAlertDebug) {
  // User left /alert-debug -> Force reload for clean state
  window.location.reload();
}
```

### 3. User Experience
- **Leaving Alert Debug:** Page reloads instantly, removing all extension UI
- **Other pages:** Extension never initializes (clean pages)
- **Returning to Alert Debug:** Fresh initialization every time

## Trade-offs

### Pros ✅
- **Zero UI interference** on non-target pages
- **Complete state reset** on every navigation
- **No memory leaks** or zombie event listeners
- **Future-proof** against new features

### Cons ⚠️
- **Page reload delay** (~1 second) when navigating away
- **Loss of form state** if users were filling forms
- **Additional network requests** for page reloads

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Manual Cleanup** - Complex, error-prone, hard to maintain
2. **Mutation Observers** - Performance overhead, still incomplete
3. **CSS Display Toggle** - Elements still in DOM, event listeners persist
4. **Force Reload** ✅ - Simple, bulletproof, chosen solution

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (target browser)
- ✅ Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Firefox (with minor differences)
- ✅ Safari (basic support)

The force reload approach works universally across all browsers that support content scripts.
